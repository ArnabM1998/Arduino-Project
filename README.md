# Arduino-Project
To make a simple way to display the humidity near us. It displays some number thatâ€™s indicate the percentage of humidity in air.
We simple use the DHT11lib function to determine the humidity in the air and indexing as per the table:
Humidity Readings Range	& the Seven_Segment_Display_Index as 
20-29%:1
30-39%:2
40-49%:3
50-59%:4
60-69%:5
70-79%:6
80-89%:7
90%:8
Anything Else of Some Fault:0
